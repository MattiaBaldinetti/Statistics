# üìä Statistics Assignments & Final Thesis
Welcome to the repository containing all the homework assignments and the final thesis for the Statistics course. This repository is organized to provide clear and structured access to all the materials developed throughout the course.

## üìö Content Overview
### Homework Assignments
Each homework folder (HW1, HW2, HW3, etc.) contains:
- Problem Statements: Description of the exercises.
- Solutions: Implementations and calculations.
- Graphs/Visualizations: Relevant plots and statistical graphs.
- Reports: Explanations and interpretations of the results.

### Final Thesis
The final thesis focuses on Quantum Probability Theory, a mathematical framework that extends classical probability into the quantum domain. It explores how non-commutative structures, Hilbert spaces, and Hermitian operators model complex phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum uncertainty. The thesis covers the foundational principles, compares classical and quantum probabilities, and examines applications in quantum computing, information theory, and cognitive s
